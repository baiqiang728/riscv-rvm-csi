      Get the number of PMP entries for the hard id.
      If the hart id is invalid, such as out of support range, it should return
      an error

        The number of PMP entry; -1 will be returned as and error code if the
        input is invalid.

    description: >
      Set PMP entry.

      This function only can be called in M-mode. If it is called
      in other mode, it will cause an access fault exception. When this function is 
      called with success, it will not be effective untill the core exits M-mode.

      Also, an error should be returned if the input parameters are invalid, such as idx
      out of range, address or size is not supported etc.

        The base address of this entry need to be configured. If the
        address-matching mode is TOR, it would be ignored. And the base address of this

        bit1[W]: indicate that the PMP entry permits to write.
        bit2[X]: indicate that the PMP entry permits to execute.
        bit4_3[A]: indicate the address-matching mode: TOR/NA4/NAPOT.
